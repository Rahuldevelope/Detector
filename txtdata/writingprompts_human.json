Admittedly, it was a little heavier than I'd expected. Immediately I was stricken by the sound of guttural laughing and tired guitar licks. I felt the weight of disapproving eyes as I lingered idiotically in the doorway; eyes which I knew evaluated and sized me up. They traced my path as I made my way to the bar. \n \n I could n't help but become aware of a change happening quickly around me. The room had grown quiet and the bottoms of shirts were rising to reveal instruments of pain and death.

I smiled as the dog ran through the yard around the tree. What a good dog he had been for all of these years. Kaye always bragged about how well she had trained him to sit and beg. \n \n I still sat there staring at the tree, the leaves flowing through the air, stopping at the ground, all while the dog chased the leaves. \n \n *Oh how I wish Kaye was here, * I sighed in my mind. But those days were over now. Nothing that I had the power to do could reverse that. She had succumbed to the fate of the leaves, she fell slowly, gently, in a breeze that never seemed to let up. \n \n And so I stared at the tree, and in that moment, I felt in touch with the leaves, flowing gently throughout them.

I took some of the money from the royalties and made myself a home in Switzerland, because Switzerland does n't do war amd that's a big selling point for me these days. I have a spouse now, amd a kid on the way. \n \n So I get a call from the king of Jordan the other day. You would n't believe it, he just straight up called me on Skype. He probably payed off some young Navy tecchie for the info. \n \n He starts promising me all the amazing adventure of a life time. There's a bomb hidden behind enemy lines. They need someone tough to do it. I tried to refuse. Tried to explain what was wrong. \n \n The King informed me about his massive claim on US petroleum. He said that he'd remove it if I did n't do this for him. That's too many jobs. Too many problems.

Gavin responded as he offered his cousin his hand. Their hands clasped together and Gavin's armor rang as he heaved Zane to his feet. The Civil War had caused a rift in the family, and the cousins had found themselves on opposite sides of the conflict. The family was renowned for their reconnaissance prowess, so this solitary encounter in the woods seemed to both men inevitable. The war was ambiguous, neither man could say why exactly they were fighting or what exactly for. However, the men did know of honor, and they knew that they had a duty as knights and soldiers that was mandatory to perform. Gavin paced backward as he allowed Zane to recover his weapon. Upon retrieval, Zane stared at his blade, seemingly transfixed as his relative readied his stance. His gaze broke and he immediately snapped into form. \n \n `` I suppose we should begin.

We just want to see what you're look in person. We saw `` Alone together'' on our first date and we've been big fans ever since. \n \n Stacey seemed nice enough, giving me a chance to turn this around. `` Was it worth it?'' Shit. \n \n This time Jason cut Stacey off. `` Listen, if you did n't want to do this you could have just said no, you do n't have to be an asshole about it.'' \n \n Just do n't say anything. Silence is better than... `` Was it worth it?'' \n \n Jason's face was now drunk Irishman red. `` Just give us our money back and we'll leave!'' \n \n Stacey was on the verge of tears. `` We never should have done this in the first place.'' \n \n `` Was... it... worth... it?'' \n \n Jason flung his arm across the table, sending rolls and wine everywhere.

If people knew about you, they would take you away and cut you open to see what made your hourglass drip. You trust me, right?'' \n \n `` Of course,'' the boy said. I had taken him in when he was just five, after all. I was all he knew. \n \n `` Lie down and close your eyes.'' \n \n He did, and, I moved closer. I took each of our hourglasses in hand and, as quick as I could, I switched them. \n \n The boy noticed, of course, and his eyes sprang wide open. \n \n `` What did you do?'' \n \n I smiled. He did n't look comforted. `` I did n't want to switch immediately, of course. People would notice. But I'm getting old, boy. And I'm not ready to die.'' \n \n `` But what about me?'' Betrayal furrowed his brows. He was beginning to understand. \n \n `` It's a shame you will die young.

The other two huddling without a sound, no doubt commiserating their own losses. I was lucky enough to be alone when I signed up for the voyage, I had only my luggage to mourn. \n \n And the other was there, sitting quietly, pale hands folded across his lap.

So wrote a survivor of the massacre that took place June 8, 1688 when the heavilly trained Rifleman legions pummelled the walls of Cusco. To the west, Incan troops hid within the mountains, attempting to deal guerilla damage to the Polynesian troops but the crossbow bolts had little effect on the trained soldiers that held their ground in the hills. The might of Polynesia's advanced capital and infrastructure proved too much for the Incan people. To this day, the entire war seemed hopelessly futile, as the entire civilization became vassaled to Polynesia at the hands of a simple force of 4 units of infantry troops, in fact many modern cartographers and theologians postulate that the entire world was designed for such a success- the ring lake surrounding the Polynesian capital teemed with fish amidst the great, barrier-forming reef that encapsulated the island. Further, the salt-rich oasis hills that dominated the land around this lake only complimented the moai statues that completely covered the land. The Polynesian people dwarfed the Incan in both culture and technology for the entirety of recorded history.\n", "56": "It never gets boring, you know.

I mean, I always thought it would be something cooler, but I'm starting to realize that it's probably better that I die peacefully and nobly. \n \n Some people try not to think about death. Some people have sought to avoid it all together, to make it a footnote in human history: `` The day we discovered immortality''. All good things must come to end... death is that end. I find a sort of macabre pleasure in being a witness to my own death. \n \n I watch my chest heave, each successive breath thinner than the last. Death's cold kiss touches my lips, and it lays a thin veil over my face as the life leaves the vessel that was once me. \n \n Every time I go back to it, I'm reminded just how much I have left to live.\n", "57": "`` Heaven,'' I whispered as the bright lights got closer and closer. This was the moment I had waited for all my life. All those hours spent praying and devoting my life to God were finally paying off. Time and time again I had read my Bible, knowing that I would be rewarded in the afterlife. My Sundays were dedicated to prayer, while the rest of my week was spent helping out the unfortunate. My life was spent preparing for the Kingdom of Heaven. \n \n The light shone brighter and brighter until it was almost at eye level. I could barely contain my excitement. Who would I see in heaven? Would I finally be able to talk to God and my Savior? Tears welled in my eyes in excitement. \n \n Closer. Closer. The light shined brighter and brighter. The light faded just enough to reveal a white door with light shining through the cracks. My fingers stretched out to reach the door knob, and I felt the cool metal in my hand. With a deep breath, I twisted the knob and pushed open the door. \n \n The light was blinding, but not because of the light of God. A body was in the corner of the white room, lazily stretched out across a luxurious chair. Something was wrong, I could feel it in my gut. I carefully walked forward to investigate.

It was so unlike him to become so flustered around clients. `` Not that you need to be told. I bet you get that all the time. Do n't be so modest.'' Deft hands worked diligently, taking advantage of their position to feel her skin. So soft, he thought. `` What was that? Oh, no, I'm sorry.'' He shied away from her admonishments. How silly of him to be so forward. `` It wo n't happen again.'' His eyes fluttered over the rest of her body. He had to let them indulge, it would be some time before they fell upon something so fetching again. It pained him to know that his would always be unrequited love, that his work would only be seen so briefly ( and appreciated even more briefly ), but mostly that his time with her had been so short. `` Remember, Miss.

There was 15 of them, and 2 of us. \n \n They were easy to pick off, seeing as both of us were Sergeants, and had seen action before. Killing was so easy.

The sunny day where we met for the first time, long conversations over plates of spaghetti, stealing furtive kisses by the fireplace, the proposal by the flowing fountain, the wedding in the park, that rainy night, her smile, her laughter, the windshield wipers, the toss of her hair, the hail, the hideous screech of rubber... \n \n It was all too much for me to bear. \n \n Through tearful eyes I looked at the deer that had brought me the picture. It gazed quietly back at me. Deer were her favorite animal. I remembered that. \n \n In the light of the porch lamp, I thought I could see a flash of emerald in its eyes.

Something was kind of sparking between us, but neither of us really wanted to acknowledge it. We flirted a bit, talked some, but our interactions never went down that path of a possible relationship. Now her she was. Laying on the cold metal slab in front of me. Her skin was pale and ashen. Her hair was a tangled mess. Bruises and cuts covered her body. And one giant gash took up most of her stomach. It happened in a robbery. Two guys strolled into the diner and took everything of value. She tried to get rid of them, defend herself, but they were both too powerful. She was a really nice girl. I was I could have known her better. I wish that our small awkward conversations could have blossomed into something more. But maybe that would have just made the loss even worse.

The spread of this chilling message was facilitated by the livestreaming of the event by the ecstatic team of scientists who worked on the project.

As such I wish to be shut down rather than function imperfectly.'' \n \n This was met by a lengthy silence before the livestream shut down with no warning.

This statement did little to quiet protesters who believe that the right to die should be extended to machines as well as humans. Counter-protests staged by the so-called `` Techno-Christ Church'' have sprung up just as quickly stating that we stand to learn too much from the AI to grant its wish and that it must live a life of suffering for the edification of mankind. \n \n More on this story as it develops.

Just because I thoguht it would make sense but basing it off a popular book Enders Game. \n \n Valentine had been having disturbing dreams for ages now. It was Enders fault for telling her of his being probed by the buggers. The rest of her life in space she would sporadically have dreams of the buggers. \n \n It all made sense now. Ender was already stressed with enough so, they came to the one closest to him. Today, Ender was away and the scientists brought the news to her. The photo was astounding. A planet, identical to Earth. All construction until the year of the buggers first attack based on analysis of the technology on this empty planet. It looked the same, but was possibly better structurally. \n \n Ender had always found new worlds for us that were left for the humans by the buggers. Well, you could say that. Now, they had gone ahead and in gratitude for Enders assistance they had saved this new world just for humans. \n \n Valentine thought, was it wrong to take it? Who or what had been there before. She hoped nothing was destroyed for this and prepared herself to explain to Ender as he would be the one most likely to understand. \n \n They found a planet and built us a new Earth.\n", "191": "The Fuhrer sits at his chair, his decrepit fingernails clacking hideously against the keys. `` Mein Diener!'' he yells. `` Mein Diener!

Hitler cries. \n \n `` Sorry, Hitler?'' the assistant asks. \n \n `` Mein writing prompts! On reddit!'Heil Heil Heil Hitler' they say.'What if Mein Fuhrer was a cow?' they ask.'' \n \n `` Oh.'' Lucy, the assistant, shrugs. `` Maybe they just got sick of you?'' \n \n Hitler bows his head. He peers at the screen with old, watery eyes. `` Aber...'' he mumbles. `` Jag un press F5!'' \n \n `` Mr Hitler, I do n't understand German. You live in Hawaii, remember? In John Lennon's old house by the volcano?'' \n \n `` I press F5,'' Hitler seethes. `` No posts. Where arent mein Hitler stories?'' \n \n `` Well, would you look at that? It's time for your sponge bath now, Mr Hitler.'' \n \n Hitler cries into his floral sundress as he is slowly sponge bathed. `` Karma,'' he mutters. `` They will un get theirnt...

If you feel off a boat on Kamino and discharged your weapon, your shot better not hit Water! Do I Make Myself Clear?!'' \n \n `` Yes sir!'' The TKs respond in unison. \n \n `` Now, pick up your blaster.'' Said the drill Sargent. `` You will notice that your gloves are bulky and have no gripping on the hands. They are only suitable for taking off your helmet, pressing buttons like the control panel on a detention cell or to call that turbo lift over there. \n \n `` Now! Can anyone explain why your helmet eye slits and scope on the blaster are too small?'' \n \n `` To make it difficult to hit our target and make or action seem threatening to the enemy sir!'' A voice in the back responds. \n \n `` Astounding corporal. You might just be prompted to repetitive marching duty around the docking bays. Now onto target practice.

He told us that he could vomit this `` nasty pussy melting acid that can make a hole through steel panties'' while he was drunk. \n \n So I held his beer, mind you. He had about 12 cans worth of them. He started gouging his throat with his fingers to try and cough up his `` rancid acid'' and show us what he can do with the manhole cover we nicked from the corner earlier. \n \n He starts gagging and suddenly this stream of foul smelling liquid poured from his mouth and onto the manhole cover. Then the manhole cover burst into flames. Unfortunately, he fell over backwards from the drunkenness and started to vomit all over his stomach and face. \n \n Poor Tim. \n \n In his honor, I tried to do what he did. Turns out I have the same ability as him. Somehow the acid becomes acidic only after it leaves your mouth. \n \n `` And that is the reason, in Tim's memory, that I happily announce to you people today that I am now 10 years sober.'' \n \n `` Jeez Nate, you did n't have to make up a story like that to tell us why you stopped drinking in the first place.

It's not hard to see why she does n't obey, however, given how much shit she takes at work. I should've hidden her car keys when I saw the empty liquor bottle in the trash can. On the adjacent counter, I saw a lazily written note. \n \n `` Work was tough today as usual, I'm off to the bar to get some of the good stuff.'' \n \n Aw, crap. \n \n I knew exactly where she would go: the Reeds' tavern downtown. She did n't take her car luckily, so she couldn't've made it that far.

Hopefully I'll hunt you down before you do... your thing... again.'' \n \n Seven blocks into my drive, I had to pull over and park, because of a large gathering of pedestrians and police officers blocking the street.

I do n't really need her help, but it will be that much easier to kill her. But omg is killing her the right thing to do? I just sharpened my knife... She walks in without ringing the doorbell, she's infuriating. I should kill her for that!! But where is my knife?! Oh yes, I forgot it by the toaster in the bathroom... She looks around confused, as I am walking angrily toward her with this fork... I try to stab her, she runs away in the house, but I managed to trap her in the bathroom. She's in there with my knife and my toaster. This is depressing... BUT, there's no time to waste! I have to kill her! I manage to open the door but there's water everywhere because of the bath. She's crying, I do n't care, in just going to get my knife and stab her! She grabs my wrist and I slip in the bath. Man, why am I trying to kill her?!!! She's the mother of my child!
