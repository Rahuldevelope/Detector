A neuromorphic computer/chip is any device that uses physical artificial neurons (made from silicon) to do computations. In recent times, the term neuromorphic has been used to describe analog, digital, mixed-mode analog/digital VLSI, and software systems that implement models of neural systems (for perception, motor control, or multisensory integration). The implementation of neuromorphic computing on the hardware level can be realized by oxide-based memristors, spintronic memories, threshold switches, transistors, among others. Training software-based neuromorphic systems of spiking neural networks can be achieved using error backpropagation, e.g., using Python based frameworks such as snnTorch,[10] or using canonical learning rules from the biological learning literature, e.g., using BindsNet.[11]\nA key aspect of neuromorphic engineering is understanding how the morphology of individual neurons, circuits, applications, and overall architectures creates desirable computations, affects how information is represented, influences robustness to damage, incorporates learning and development, adapts to local change (plasticity), and facilitates evolutionary change.\nNeuromorphic engineering is an interdisciplinary subject that takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer science, and electronic engineering to design artificial neural systems, such as vision systems, head-eye systems, auditory processors, and autonomous robots, whose physical architecture and design principles are based on those of biological nervous systems.[12] One of the first applications for neuromorphic engineering was proposed by Carver Mead[13] in the late 1980s.", "3": "I imagine that the main reason is because the teams keep changing .

It is unlikely that the entire account has negative equity since a responsible broker would forcibly close all positions and pursue the holder for the balance of the debt to reduce solvency risk.  Since the broker has automatically exercised a near the money option, it's solvency policy is already risky. Regardless of whether there is negative equity or simply a liability, the least risky course of action is to sell enough of the underlying to satisfy the loan by closing all other positions if necessary as soon as possible. If there is a negative equity after trying to satisfy the loan, the account will need to be funded for the balance of the loan to pay for purchases of the underlying to fully satisfy the loan. Since the underlying can move in such a way to cause this loan to increase, the account should also be funded as soon as possible if necessary. Accounts after exercise For deep in the money exercised options, a call turns into a long underlying on margin while a put turns into a short underlying. The next decision should be based upon risk and position selection.  First, if the position is no longer attractive, it should be closed.  Since it's deep in the money, simply closing out the exposure to the underlying should extinguish the liability as cash is not marginable, so the cash received from the closing out of the position will repay any margin debt. If the position in the underlying is still attractive then the liability should be managed according to one's liability policy and of course to margin limits. In a margin account, closing the underlying positions on the same day as the exercise will only be considered a day trade.  If the positions are closed on any business day after the exercision, there will be no penalty or restriction. Cash option accounts While this is possible, many brokers force an upgrade to a margin account, and the ShareBuilder Options Account Agreement seems ambiguous, but their options trading page implies the upgrade. In a cash account, equities are not marginable, so any margin will trigger a margin call.  If the margin debt did not trigger a margin call then it is unlikely that it is a cash account as margin for any security in a cash account except for certain options trades is 100%. Equities are convertible to cash presumably at the bid, so during a call exercise, the exercisor or exercisor's broker pays cash for the underlying at the exercise price, and any deficit is financed with debt, thus underlying can be sold to satisfy that debt or be sold for cash as one normally would. To preempt a forced exercise as a call holder, one could short the underlying, but this will be more expensive, and since probably no broker allows shorting against the box because of its intended use to circumvent capital gains taxes by fraud.

Under various schemes that company need not pay you at all. For example it may make you a loan which is not taxed (ie you don't pay tax on a loan, just as you don't pay tax on the money lent you by a mortgage company). You are bound by the terms of the loan agreement to repay that loan at a rate that the company finds acceptable. Indeed the company may find eventually that it is simply convenient to write off the loan as unrecoverable. if the owners/officers of he company write off your loans, how much tax will you have paid on the money you have had as   loans? The taxman can of course state that this was simply set up to avoid tax (which is illegal) so you should have a balancing scheme to show that that the loans were taken to supplement income,just as one might take a bank loan / mortgage, not replace it entirely as a tax scam.

The only way to prevent the other side from attacking you , is to make sure you are strong enough to hit back , Deterrence Theory in a nutshell . They did this in a lot of ways . To begin with ( not long after WWII , the 50 's roughly ) , there were just nuclear bombs , ICBM 's ( Inter - Continental Ballistic Missiles ) did n't exist yet . The US set up a rotating system of bombers carrying nuclear weapons flying 24/7 near the Soviet borders ready to retaliate against a USSR invasion of Europe , with pre - written orders to be carried out if certain criteria were met . I do nt know what exactly the Soviets had like this in turn but I imagine it was something similar , ready to attack European targets . So 24/7 you had a bunch of planes flying around with nuclear bombs , its not a simple task to just shoot them down in an age before ballistic missile technology was really all that developed . Around the 1960 's , ICBM 's were starting to become a thing , which made it a lot harder . Both sides developed a ton of them , hid them around their nation ( and allies ) inside fortified silos . To take them all out with your own missiles , you would need to * A ) Know where they all are . * B ) Be able to hit them precisely enough to do any real damage ( this was a big issue early on , the first few generations of ICBM could only reliably hit something the size of a city ) . * C ) Have multiple missiles for every silo the enemy had ( they were tough ) . * D ) Destroy them quickly enough that they ca nt fire back in time . * E ) Have even more missiles to shoot at conventional targets like cities and military bases , because you need to do more than just blow up their missiles . * F ) Have even more missiles on top of that , because both sides were also developing systems to shoot down ICBM 's to defend themselves , the Soviets in particular . So you might need to dedicate multiple missiles to guarantee a hit on important targets . and both sides knew this , so they both just kept building more and more silos and missiles .

She was the first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.\nAda Byron was the only legitimate child of poet Lord Byron and Lady Byron. All of Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England forever. Four months later, he commemorated the parting in a poem that begins, \"Is thy face like thy mother's my fair child! ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?\" He died in Greece when Ada was eight. Her mother remained bitter and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing her father's perceived insanity. Despite this, Ada remained interested in him, naming her two sons Byron and Gordon. Upon her death, she was buried next to him at her request. Although often ill in her childhood, Ada pursued her studies assiduously. She married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, Ada thereby becoming Countess of Lovelace.\nHer educational and social exploits brought her into contact with scientists such as Andrew Crosse, Charles Babbage, Sir David Brewster, Charles Wheatstone, Michael Faraday, and the author Charles Dickens, contacts which she used to further her education. Ada described her approach as \"poetical science\" and herself as an \"Analyst (& Metaphysician)\".\nWhen she was eighteen, her mathematical talents led her to a long working relationship and friendship with fellow British mathematician Charles Babbage, who is known as \"the father of computers\". She was in particular interested in Babbage's work on the Analytical Engine. Lovelace first met him in June 1833, through their mutual friend, and her private tutor, Mary Somerville.\nBetween 1842 and 1843, Ada translated an article by Italian military engineer Luigi Menabrea about the Analytical Engine, supplementing it with an elaborate set of notes, simply called \"Notes\". Lovelace's notes are important in the early history of computers, containing what many consider to be the first computer program—that is, an algorithm designed to be carried out by a machine. Other historians reject this perspective and point out that Babbage's personal notes from the years 1836/1837 contain the first programs for the engine.[10] She also developed a vision of the capability of computers to go beyond mere calculating or number-crunching, while many others, including Babbage himself, focused only on those capabilities.[11] Her mindset of \"poetical science\" led her to ask questions about the Analytical Engine (as shown in her notes) examining how individuals and society relate to technology as a collaborative tool.", "38": "You know , Champ , not to eat rich food right before you go to sleep .

So if you add salt into your body , you increase the concentration of electrolytes , therefore more water is retained to correct that concentration .. and increased volume = increased pressure .. think about a balloon , as you fill it up with more and more air the pressure increases till it explodes ! = increased blood pressure .

The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene, with the purpose of finding objects, identifying materials, or detecting processes. There are three general branches of spectral imagers. There are push broom scanners and the related whisk broom scanners (spatial scanning), which read images over time, band sequential scanners (spectral scanning), which acquire images of an area at different wavelengths, and snapshot hyperspectral imaging, which uses a staring array to generate an image in an instant.\nWhereas the human eye sees color of visible light in mostly three bands (long wavelengths - perceived as red, medium wavelengths - perceived as green, and short wavelengths - perceived as blue), spectral imaging divides the spectrum into many more bands. This technique of dividing images into bands can be extended beyond the visible. In hyperspectral imaging, the recorded spectra have fine wavelength resolution and cover a wide range of wavelengths. Hyperspectral imaging measures continuous spectral bands, as opposed to multiband imaging which measures spaced spectral bands.\nEngineers build hyperspectral sensors and processing systems for applications in astronomy, agriculture, molecular biology, biomedical imaging, geosciences, physics, and surveillance. Hyperspectral sensors look at objects using a vast portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. Certain objects leave unique 'fingerprints' in the electromagnetic spectrum. Known as spectral signatures, these 'fingerprints' enable identification of the materials that make up a scanned object.

This means that you could possibly end up selling some or all of your position at a price lower than your trigger price. For relatively illiquid securities your order may be split into transactions with several buyers at different prices and you could see a significant drop in price between the first part of the order and the last few shares. To mitigate this, brokers also offer a stop-limit order, where you set not only a trigger price, but also a minimum price that you are will to accept for your shares. This reduces the risk of selling at rock bottom prices, especially if you are selling a very large position. However, in the case of a flash crash where other sellers are driving the price below your limit, that part of your order may never execute and you could end up being stuck with a whole lot of shares that are worth less than both your stop loss trigger and limit price. For securities that are liquid and not very volatile, either option is a pretty safe way to cut your losses. For securities that are illiquid and/or very volatile a stop-limit order will prevent you from cashing out at bottom dollar and giving away a bargain to lurkers hanging out at the bottom of the market, but you may end up stuck with shares you don't want for longer than originally planned.

The data mart is a subset of the data warehouse and is usually oriented to a specific business line or team. Whereas data warehouses have an enterprise-wide depth, the information in data marts pertains to a single department. In some deployments, each department or business unit is considered the owner of its data mart including all the hardware, software and data.  This enables each department to isolate the use, manipulation and development of their data. In other deployments where conformed dimensions are used, this business unit owner will not hold true for shared dimensions like customer, product, etc.\nWarehouses and data marts are built because the information in the database is not organized in a way that makes it readily accessible. This organization requires queries that are too complicated, difficult to access or resource intensive.\nWhile transactional databases are designed to be updated, data warehouses or marts are read only. Data warehouses are designed to access large groups of related records. Data marts improve end-user response time by allowing users to have access to the specific type of data they need to view most often, by providing the data in a way that supports the collective view of a group of users.\nA data mart is basically a condensed and more focused version of a data warehouse that reflects the regulations and process specifications of each business unit within an organization. Each data mart is dedicated to a specific business function or region. This subset of data may span across many or all of an enterprise's functional subject areas.

For expense incurred before you started the business: What Are Deductible Startup Costs? The IRS defines “startup costs” as deductible capital expenses that are used to pay for: 1) The cost of “investigating the creation or acquisition of an active trade or business.” This includes costs incurred for surveying markets, product analysis, labor supply, visiting potential business locations and similar expenditures. 2) The cost of getting a business ready to operate (before you open your doors or start generating income). These include employee training and wages, consultant fees, advertising, and travel costs associated with finding suppliers, distributors, and customers. These expenses can only be claimed if your research and preparation ends with the formation of a successful business. The IRS has more information on how to claim the expenses if you don’t go into business. https://www.sba.gov/blogs/startup-cost-tax-deductions-how-write-expense-starting-your-business Once your business is underway, you can deduct expenses, but the exact details depend on how you organized.  If you're a sole proprietor for tax purposes, then you'll deduct them on Schedule C of your Form 1040 on your personal tax.  If you are a partnership, C-Corp, or S-Corp, they will be accounted at the business level and either passed on to you on a Schedule K (partnership and S-Corp) or deducted directly by the company (C-Corp).

This is done by performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results.\nThe process of data dredging involves testing multiple hypotheses using a single data set by exhaustively searching—perhaps for combinations of variables that might show a correlation, and perhaps for groups of cases or observations that show differences in their mean or in their breakdown by some other variable.\nConventional tests of statistical significance are based on the probability that a particular result would arise if chance alone were at work, and necessarily accept some risk of mistaken conclusions of a certain type (mistaken rejections of the null hypothesis).  This level of risk is called the significance. When large numbers of tests are performed, some produce false results of this type; hence 5% of randomly chosen hypotheses might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 5% significance level, 1% might be (erroneously) reported to be statistically significant at the 1% significance level, and so on, by chance alone. When enough hypotheses are tested, it is virtually certain that some will be reported to be statistically significant (even though this is misleading), since almost every data set with any degree of randomness is likely to contain (for example) some spurious correlations. If they are not cautious, researchers using data mining techniques can be easily misled by these results.\nData dredging is an example of disregarding the multiple comparisons problem.

They meet with you in person, advise you on what retirement and savings accounts to get, they talk to you to evaluate your risk preferences.  They will talk to you about planning for your kids' college and about your insurance situation. They will probably attend your kids' bar mitzvahs and stuff too.  Of course, this isn't free.  With Edward Jones you will pay a fixed percentage of your managed wealth to them every year.  And they will likely put your money in expensive mutual funds.  And those mutual funds will charge a special 12b-1 fee, which is a kickback to the wealth manager.  Plan on giving 2% or so of your total wealth to the manager per year, plus whatever the mutual funds charge.   I don't have experience with Betterment, but they appear to be a robo advisor.

I don't know their cost structure, but presumably it will be significantly cheaper than Edward Jones.  They will almost certainly put you in cheaper funds (index funds and ETF's).  Think of it as a cost-conscious alternative to Edward Jones. Vanguard is a discount broker and a mutual fund family.  Their funds are among the biggest and cheapest in the world.  Fees on many of these funds will be a fraction of the equivalent funds Edward Jones will put you in.  They will charge you nothing at all to manage your money.  They will give you some assistance and advice if you call them but don't expect any house calls.  They aren't particularly in the business of giving advice.  If you know what you want to invest in, this is the cheapest way to do it by far.  Basically you won't have to pay anything at all except the actual cost of the assets you are investing in. Which is the best?  Depends on your own preferences and ability.  If you do not want to learn about personal finance and don't particularly care about whether you are getting the best return--if you don't mind paying for a personal touch--Edward Jones might be a good choice.  For most people who are comfortable asking this type of question online and interested in learning about finance even a little bit, I'd expect that Betterment or Vanguard will be a better choice.

Various methods delegated the task in the past , including the appointed position of governor , and a Board of Commissioners . In recent decades , the elected office of Mayor was put in place and an elected City Council was created , which writes and votes on laws , but all laws they pass still require the OK of Congress to go into effect ( This is known as Home Rule ) . The residents of DC also do not have voting members of Congress . There are no Senators for DC . There is a member of the House of Representatives who is a non - voting member . Until recently , DC residents could n't vote for President , but this was changed and DC now has electoral votes which equal what they would get * if * a state , but ca n't be more than the smallest state ( This is from the 23rd Amendment ) .", "130": "Because cops are trained to elicit statements from you , for better or worse , they 're cued up on your behavior / conduct ( brother - in - law is a cop , have been on three ride - alongs ) . If approached by a cop YOU ASK THEM : \" Am I free to leave ? \" MAKE THEM answer the question , they 'll dodge it . If and when they say \" Yes , you are free to leave . \" LEAVE . Asking that question and subsequently walking away DOES NOT / CANNOT constitutionally create suspicion to fuel Reasonable Suspicion , etc . ( Even though a cop will think \" WTF \" . ) Cops can approach you for ANY reason , just to make small talk . If that small talk leads to articulable facts of Reasonable Suspicion , then good on them , bad on you . Having said this , I bet only the most cop - hating person could actually pull this off - we 're trained socially to obey authority ( Cops know this , and use it to their advantage ) . ( Parentheticals suck , too . ) If you ask \" Am I free to leave ? \" And a cop says \" No \" you are probably being detained for investigatory purposes but not under arrest - DON'T SAY A FUCKING WORD TO THEM ( I actually really like cops and still live by this . ) Cops have to * Mirandize * you if Custodial Interrogation is present - Custody meaning a reasonable person would not feel free to leave and Interrogation , roughly asking you questions designed to elicit incriminating responses . Cops can ask you your name , where you live , that 's not interrogation for * Miranda * purposes . The reason you have a right to a lawyer is because you do n't know the legal system and it would be unfair to fuck you over for something you do n't know about , essentially , you are at a disadvantage - whether or not you are educated , whatever that means - to the cop who does this exact type of questioning hundreds if not thousands of times a year . Furthermore , cops do n't have any duty to explain to you what your rights are . The problem is , arrestees think they can outsmart the cops and end up talking themselves right into incarceration . As a future public defender friend of mine once said , \" the best advice you can give your defendant - client is \" Shut the fuck up . And let me do the talking . \" If you are arrested and subsequently * Mirandized * note the following : Your 5th Amendment Right To Remain Silent must be expressed UNEQUIVOCALLY - you actually have to say out loud \" I want to remain silent . \" As to your right to have an attorney , say it UNEQUIVOCALLY \" I WANT TO SPEAK TO A / MY LAWYER . \" That phrase will cut off , constitutionally speaking , any further questions for the time being - subject to some nuances later on down the line . Even if you say \" I think I 'd like to talk to a lawyer \" to a cop , the cop has no duty to explain to you that you have to ask unequivocally - in fact , he or she probably wo n't even ask what you mean by that but just keep interrogating you . When talking to cops do n't say \" I think \" or \" Maybe I \" or \" My dad said I should get a lawyer \" none of that equals \" I WANT TO TALK TO A LAWYER . \" I could go on forever with multiple scenarios of when you have n't been * Mirandized * but are still being subjected to Custodial Interrogation - for example , if cops have a valid arrest warrant for you , come into your house , catch you sleeping in your bed and they are in your room and start asking you questions , you 're in custody . Conversely , if you voluntarily go into a police station because they asked you to come in to answer questions , and you answer those questions in a fashion that fucks you over , that 's NOT custody , you were there voluntarily , even if you were asked these questions in an interrogation room . It 's also a good idea to stay mum because even though your words might be rendered inadmissible against you in the prosecution 's case , physical evidence ( the smoking gun , the spliff ) gained from an illegal confession will be admissible ( certain nuances there , but that 's the general rule ) against your bumbling ass . tl;dr - say you want to remain silent , say you want to speak to your lawyer .

Population booms are mostly a thing of the past ( outside sub - Saharan Africa ) . Two factors are immigrants and birth rates . The US takes on a lot of immigrants , more than any country on earth , both legal and illegal . They take on a million legal immigrants and an unknown amount of illegal immigrants a year . Canada , it should be noted takes the highest * percentage * of immigrants . The US has citizenship by birth , so immigrants that come here and have children automatically gain citizenship for them and tend to stay . Generally the rule of thumb is , immigrants come from poorer countries and the birthrate is higher so the women tend to have more children than regular American women . This only lasts one generation as immigrants assimilate very quickly in America , but this is the reason for the increasing population . China is not experiencing a population boom , in fact , China 's population is leveling off . You can call it good or bad , but China 's birth policies are working . China 's birthrate is very low now and by the next decade , India will pass China as the most populated country on earth . A sad side effect is that many little girls that were to be born were aborted , abandoned , given away or killed after birth because of the cultural preference for a \" male heir \" for a family . This has really messed up the gender ratio in China and there are an estimated 50 million Chinese men who will NEVER marry . That 's more men than in all of Germany who will be single for life unless they manage to find brides overseas .

First, there is a normal annual deposit limit of $13,000 per parent or donee. This is the gift limit, due to rise to $14,000 in 2013.  If your goal is strictly to fund college, and this limit isn't an issue for you, the one account may be fine unless both kids are in school at the same time. In that case, you're going to need to change beneficiaries every year to assign withdrawals properly.  But, as you mention, there's gift money that your considering depositing to the account. In this case, there's really a legal issue. The normal 529 allows changes in beneficiary, and gifts to your child need to be held for that child in an irrevocable arrangement such as a UTMA account. There is a 529 flavor that provides for no change of beneficiary, a UTMA 529. Clearly, in that case, you need separate accounts.  In conclusion, I think the single account creates more issues than it potentially solves. If the true gift money from others is minimal, maybe you should just keep it in a regular account. Edit - on further reflection, I strongly suggest you keep the relatives' gifts in a separate account, and when the kids are old enough to have legitimate earned income, use this money to open and deposit to Roth IRAs. They can deposit the lesser of their earned income or $5000 in 2012, $5500 in 2013.  This serves two goals - avoiding the risk of gift money being 'stolen' from one child for benefit of the other, and putting it into an account that can help your children long term, but not impact college aid as would a simple savings or brokerage account.", "173": "With sufficient funds and contacts , sure .

In the long run the $$$ you “save” in a cheaper transaction might cost you more in the headaches and annoyance you have to swallow in dealing with this “bargain” in the future. Your question is this: “Do his sales tactics indicate other underlying problems? How can I deal effectively with those tactics?” And you state this as well: “To make a long story short, the dealer's aggressive sales tactics have made me somewhat uncomfortable.” And finally ask: “How can I deal effectively with those tactics?” Okay, first and foremost if you feel discomfort in anything in life—not just a financial situation—just walk away. You might have to say “No…” when doing this but it’s not always the case you will have to counter aggression with aggression. And specifically in the case of a purchase like this, you need to also ask yourself: “Is this discount being offered me worth the headache I am getting?” At the end of the day money is meaningless and has it’s main worth as an economic motivator/stimulator: Someone has a need and someone else has something that can solve that need. What would it take for the side of need to connect to the side of solution to that need? This is the basic concept surrounding all economics. So that said, I have personally avoided buying things for less money and paid slightly more elsewhere for a service experience that made me feel comfortable. At the end of the day, if you feel happy in the transaction it helps in the long run more than—let’s say—the $20 to $40 you “save” by buying from someone else.

The \"awhile\" part is quite important in answering this question. If your intentions are to invest for a relatively short time period (say, 7 years or less), it may be especially advantageous to invest in a REIT. The foremost advantage comes from significantly lower transaction fees (stock/ETF trades are practically/potentially free today) compared to purchasing real estate, which involves inspection+titling fees/taxes/broker fees, which in a round-trip transaction (purchase and sale) would come to ~10%. The secondary advantage to owning a REIT is they are much more liquid than a property. If you wanted to sell your investment at a given point in time, you can easily log into your brokerage and execute your transaction, while liquidating an investment property will take time on market/potentially tossing tenants/fixing up place, etc. On the other hand, illiquid investments have generally yielded higher historical returns according to past research.", "180": "It does n't , really , but the democrats are going to beat that drum as long as they can .", "181": "The computer uses a random number generator for things like accuracy .
