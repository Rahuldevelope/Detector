{"0": "Well , the way I like to think of it is this : when your body senses anything , it counteracts it with the opposite effect of whatever you were feeling . If you put your hand in warm water , after a while it wo n't feel as warm , and when you take your hand out of the water , it will feel cold for a moment or two until your body can adjust . It does no good for your hand to keep telling your brain that it 's warm . It does n't need a constant feed of the same information , so it essentially negates a little bit of the warmth so your hand will stop bothering it and your brain can focus on other things . The same happens with your eyes . If you look at something long enough , your brain will add a little bit of the opposite color so your eyes are n't constantly telling your brain everything that it sees . But if you suddenly take away ( or change ) that feed from your eyes , you have an afterimage . The afterimage is that negating effect from your brain before your brain realizes that something different is happening .", "1": "Most Likely the US and European Countries in NATO will conduct air raids on Syrian military and government positions like what happened in Libya .", "2": "Most of them are n't very sophisticated - definitely not what most people think of by \" artificial intelligence \" .

If you 're playing a record , you can even hear it with your speakers off . Just put your ear close to the needle and you 'll hear the music . The record is covered in a big long groove that spirals from the outside towards the inside . This groove guides the needle . Along the inside of that groove is a series of bumps . When the needle passes over these bumps , it bounces like when you 're in a car and you hit a bump , although on a much smaller scale . These bounces are what make your music . Now before we had electric record players , there were these things call gramophones ( hence the Grammys ) . In the gramophone , the needle was attached to a membrane that would vibrate as the needle bounced along . The vibrating membrane acted like a driver in your speakers , and there was a large cone to amplify the sound . But who has one of those anymore ? This is n't a perfect analogy but I think it 'll do the trick . Think about the way that gramophone worked , but instead of being physically attached to the membrane ( or speaker ) there was a tube full of water . As the needle bounces , it sends vibrations through the water in the form of small waves . When these waves strike the membrane and it shakes , making sound in your speakers . That is pretty much how the electric record players work , except instead of water it uses electricity , and its ' waves ' are actually changing current in the wire . There is a device in the record player that changes the bouncing of the needle into an electric signal whose current changes depending on how it moves . This signal is then sent through the wires to your speakers . There , it makes your speakers move by running through a small electromagnet . Sorry for the long winded response . EDIT : Oh , by the way . Records are * made * by just running that process in reverse , and instead of a need ' reading ' bumps , the bumps and grooves are carved into the piece of vinyl .", "4": "(Real) interest rates are so low because governments want people to use their money to improve the economy by spending or investing rather than saving. Their idea is that by consuming or investing you will help to create jobs that will employ people who will spend or invest their pay, and so on. If you want to keep this money for the future you don't want to spend it and interest rates make saving unrewarding therefore you ought to invest. That was the why, now the how. Inflation protected securities, mentioned in another answer, are the least risk way to do this. These are government guaranteed and very unlikely to default. On the other hand deflation will cause bigger problems for you and the returns will be pitiful compared with historical interest rates. So what else can be done? Investing in companies is one way of improving returns but risk starts to increase so you need to decide what risk profile is right for you.  Investing in companies does not mean having to put money into the stock market either directly or indirectly (through funds) although index tracker funds have good returns and low risk. The corporate bond market is lower risk for a lesser reward than the stock market but with better returns than current interest rates. Investment grade bonds are very low risk, especially in the current economic climate and there are exchange traded funds (ETFs) to diversify more risk away. Since you don't mention willingness to take risk or the kind of amounts that you have to save I've tried to give some low risk options beyond \"buy something inflation linked\" but you need to take care to understand the risks  of any product you buy or use, be they a bank account, TIPS, bond investments or whatever.

GPUs are used in embedded systems, mobile phones, personal computers, workstations, and game consoles.\nModern GPUs are efficient at manipulating computer graphics and image processing. Their parallel structure makes them more efficient than general-purpose central processing units (CPUs) for algorithms that process large blocks of data in parallel. In a personal computer, a GPU can be present on a video card or embedded on the motherboard. In some CPUs, they are embedded on the CPU die.\nIn the 1970s, the term \"GPU\" originally stood for graphics processor unit and described a programmable processing unit independently working from the CPU and responsible for graphics manipulation and output. Later, in 1994, Sony used the term (now standing for graphics processing unit) in reference to the PlayStation console's Toshiba-designed Sony GPU in 1994. The term was popularized by Nvidia in 1999, who marketed the GeForce 256 as \"the world's first GPU\". It was presented as a \"single-chip processor with integrated transform, lighting, triangle setup/clipping, and rendering engines\".

Then the engine would spit out generic outputs , which the API layer would transform into platform - specific graphics and whatnot . Our art teams , meanwhile , would typically have to export all of their materials in a different format for each platform , to best leverage that platform 's graphics system . The advantage of this approach is that you spend less time customizing the game for each platform . The chief disadvantage is that it 's harder to really push the boundaries of what each system can do , and you end up with games that are a bit less ambitious , have less jaw - dropping visuals , and run a bit slower .

But you owe your broker 10 shares, which you need to return sometime in the future. A few days later, the share price has decreased to $80. Now you can buy 10 shares from the market at a total cost of $800. You get 10 shares, and return those shares to your broker.

Muslims accept the Jewish prophets ; however , they believe that Jesus was just another prophet and that the messiah has not yet come . * Muslims have [ similar dietary restrictions ] ( URL_0 ) ( * halaal * ) to Jews . * Muslims have a number of rituals they are required to perform , including 5 prayers a day , facing towards Mecca ; fasting during the month of Ramadan ; and the * Hajj * , a once - in - a - lifetime pilgrimage to the city of Mecca , which houses the * [ Ka'aba ] ( URL_1 ) * , the holiest site in Islam . * Islam had a major schism over who got to succeed Muhammad as the leader of the religion . Shia Muslims stem from a the faction who supported Ali bin Abu Talib , Muhammad 's cousin and son - in - law . Sunni Muslims supported Abu Bakr , his friend and advisor . * While there are of course differences of opinion , the general theme of the Qur'an 's opinion of Jews and Christians is \" They 're doing what God said , cut 'em some slack \" .

Many dialects of English ( for example , British ) are non - rhotic , which means that the letter R after a vowel is not pronounced . So whereas an American speaker would say \" hard \" with a clear \" R \" , a British speaker would say it similar to \" hahd \" or \" hawd \" . When a word ending with a vowel is followed by another word starting with a vowel , it can sound a bit clumsy having two consecutive vowels , which is why in English and other languages , a consonant is inserted , for example , instead of \" a apple \" , we use the word \" an \" which serves to insert a consonant : \" an apple \" In such case , if the first word ends with a non - rhotic R ( which comes out as vowel sound ) , a speaker of non - rhotic English will insert a consonant sound by pronouncing the otherwise silent R. So whereas a British speaker would normally pronounce \" car \" as \" cah \" , the phrase \" car at … \" would come out as \" car at \" with a pronounced R. If you get used to inserting an R in certain cases , such as \" car at \" , it becomes so natural that at times you will do it even if the first word does n't end with an R , but sounds like the kind of word that would . So \" saw a film \" becomes \" sawr a film \" , and eventually , even if it 's not followed by an vowel , you might end up saying \" sawr \" .", "42": "I would assume its not to do with blood but to do with nerves .

They try to put policies in place that directly provide money or services to these people at the expense of the more wealthy members of society . The disadvantage is that it puts a disproportionate burden on the wealthy , since they have to pay not only to support their families but also contribute to poorer families . Any system or policy put in place at a government level can be gamed , and it also carries a certain level of inefficiency and bureaucracy . Additionally , individuals do n't get to choose which parts of their taxes to pay , so if you do n't care about the arts and do n't want to support them , a portion of your taxes will still go to fund them . The advantage is that these policies provide greater opportunity for people to rise from poorer classes . People born into poor homes start off with disadvantages - just a few examples would be that they ca n't afford high - quality food , have to attend schools with less funding , and are more likely to grow up with domestic violence . As a result , they are less likely to go to a good college , and thus less likely to get a good job . The deck is stacked against them , and democrats aim to fight that a little bit , arguing that even if their policies are imperfect , they are worth it . Republicans believe that these policies should be limited in order to keep them as efficient as possible . They believe that what you earn should belong to you , and that good people will help the poor anyways , but that forcing you to fund certain programs that you may not agree with is n't fair . The argument is that the \" American dream \" means coming from nothing and making something of yourself , and if you do that then you deserve to reap all the benefits of your determination and hard work . They also argue that rich people and wealthy companies have more money to hire workers , which therefore creates jobs . The disadvantage of this is that once someone is rich , their kids tend to do better , and poor people are stuck by the wayside ; a few people climb the ladder but it becomes increasingly difficult to do that , so it is advantageous to the people already in power and harmful to others . The advantage is that wasteful spending is reduced and people can choose what to fund rather than having the government decide for them . The Tea Party has become a big part of the Republican party , but it 's actually quite unique and I think it should be separated out . The Tea Party is vehemently opposed to a lot of government policies . Think Republicans on steroids . However , the Tea Party relies on sensationalizing false facts and figures to make their case . For example , many Tea Party politicians state that the US was founded as a Christian nation , which is explicitly NOT true according to writings from the founding fathers . They often say that programs cost more than they actually do or blame the current administration for policies that were actually created under the previous administration . They do not seem to fact check most of their claims , but they say them convincingly and people assume they know what they 're talking about . They refuse to compromise on legislation ( which completely obstructs the process of creating laws ) , and thus make congress unable to get things done , and then use the fact that congress is n't doing anything as evidence when they complain that government is broken . Historically , Republicans and Democrats have been able to work out their differences to pass programs that are in the public interest while keeping them small enough to minimize their impact on your paycheck . A great example is Medicare , which was passed with bipartisan support in 1965 and helps us pay for care for the people over 65 , which is the time when care is most expensive and also the time when people are not working and thus wo n't have insurance through their employer . The parties have been growing apart for a while , but the advent of the Tea Party in the last several years has really highlighted their differences , and forced Democrats to be the party of \" Big Government \" and Republicans to be the party of \" Rich Privilege \" . The people we elect to congress are increasingly more extreme on both sides , so it 's harder to reconcile differences and work together to govern .", "46": "I do nt see a good comment yet that explains the fact \" Film \" has a far higher resolution than 1080p already , and always did . The image quality is already stored in the film . The reason the movies were not shown in 1080p was because the technology to display the film at its maximum level of detail was not available . yes , The film \" back to the future \" was shot on has greater than 1080p definition . But its pointless when TV 's could only display 420p or w / e. Thus the VHS 's for example were \" formatted \" down to 420p etc etc . Digital technology on the whole has far less resolution than the original film stock . Digitals primary advantage is ease of transfer and editing and uniformity of display medium . They do not even have to \" Apply digital or computer algorithms \" . Film again already has a greater than 1080p resolution . How do you think cinemas worked ? Using \" Film \" they were able to give you a higher quality picture than a typical television set fixed at 3 - 500p on a surface several hundered times the size . So really , the movies in the cinemas in the 80 's actually were around 20 - 30,000 P if not more .. P just = pixels per line . They do not need to enhance anything , the image quality is there in the film . They just convert it into a format that can be displayed on your new device . using them 1 's and 0 's we all like . But they do not need to add or polish anything at all to get \" 1080p \" TL : DR + PS Film was always greater than 1080p , Cinemas in the 80 's had the equivilant of XX,000p The only difference is , now our Tv 's \" Work \" at 1080p on a small display device . As your screen gets larger 1080p will look more and more vague and standard definition like and if you make your screen large enough , 1080p will look like blue and red blocks because 1080p is a resolution not an indicator of quality or data . Modern cinemas are FAR higher than 1080p . If you took 1080 and broadcast it onto a cinema screen you would see pixel after pixel like a potato filmed it .", "47": "Scientific creationism is an attempt to reconcile the literal genesis account in the bible with scientific observations .

It would be independent of anything.  It pays out the same return in all states of nature.  The definition of a risk-free asset is that regardless of how the universe turns out, including a meteor striking the Earth killing everyone but the recipient, then the payout would happen exactly as planned.  One could imagine a computer still being on, connected to a power supply and printing a check.  Most people use the 90-day t-bill as the risk-free rate.  A beta greater than one implies it is more volatile than the market, not that it moves more perfectly. The CAPM should not be used for this.  Cryptocurrencies should not be used with this model because they have valuation dynamics related to the new issue of coins.  In other words, they have non-market price movements as well as market price movements. In general, you should not use the CAPM because it doesn't work empirically.  It is famous, but it is also wrong.  A scientific hypothesis that is not supported by the data is a bad idea.  My strong recommendation is that you read \"The Intelligent Investor,\" by Benjamin Graham.  It was last published in 1972, and it is still being printed.  I believe Warren Buffett wrote the current forward for it.  Always go where the data supports you and never anywhere else, no matter how elegant.

If you want to learn how to do this, start with the \"Intelligent Investor.\"  Get a basic book on accounting and learn basic accounting.  Pick up economics textbooks at least through \"Intermediate\" for both microeconomics and macroeconomics.  Get William Bolstad's book \"Introduction to Bayesian Statistics.\"  You will need them for reasons that go very far beyond this post.  Trust me; you want to master that book.  Find a statistician and ask them to teach it to you as a special topics course.  It will help you as both either a Marine officer or a Naval officer.  Then after that pick up a copy of \"Security Analysis.\"  Either the 1943 copy (yes it is in print) by Benjamin Graham if you feel good about accounting, or the 1987 copy by Cottle under the Graham/Dodd imprimatur.  Then, if you are still interested in cryptocurrencies and they will be blasé by then, then pick up an economics textbook on money.

There are a lot of reasons , and a lot of bad assumptions made in the question . First , lets discuss the state of technology globally in the era of Columbus- I think that meeting time is the most relevant to the question . The central american tribes had huge urban cities with a complicated social structure and specialized trades , along with aquaculture and waterworks . Some North American tribes had complex democratic empires- which I would argue is a technological advancement over lineage - based monarchies in Europe of the time . They had an incredible knowledge of astronomy and goldsmithing . In china , there was artillery and gunpowder , but it was still feudal . In europe , there was a very complex system of government and international trade , but people were still putting their sewage in the street . The main technological differences between old and world and new are sea - going vessels , gunpowder , steel / iron / advanced metallurgy , and horses , which is n't really that much . I think the worlds were more similar than OP might suspect . Ocean - going vessels are necessary for Europeans , but not for Native americans , because trade was much more prevalent in Europe , as it had developed specialized farming , and then more general specialization- meaning that surplus food and good had to be shipped . Of course , it helps that there is a more diverse and larger landmass connected to europe ( this will be a recurring theme- the ships of egypt in 2500 BC became the ships of Greece , then Rome , then Spain . Europe got gunpowder from China ) . Horses are important . There were no animals of the genus equus on the american supercontinent from between the last ice age and the landing of Columbus in 1493- several escaped and went wild , and those are the ancestors of the wild and domesticated horses we have today . The horse- and all the other large , domesticatable mammals on the afro - eurasian supercontinent- allowed a wider range of trade , and greater international collarboration . Native Americans had to travel by foot , which limited their range . I do n't know anything about advanced metal - working , but I 'm going to assume the same points as gunpowder and ships applies . Tl;dr : A larger and more varied landmass , more easily traveled by horse than by foot , allowed for faster communication and trade , which means that more technology was assimilated by more cultures in the time frame .", "52": "Hello,Welcome to HCM,Rabies is a disease which is also transmitted by bite of the monkey, it is a 100% fatal disease but it is 100% preventable by proper and adequate treatment.As you have been bit by dog previously for which you have taken three dose of antirabies vaccine and once again you have been bitten by the dog for which you taken some treatment.According WHO categorizes who have to be categorized into Re-exposure categorizes.

The United States government budgets money on an annual basis for a period of time called the \" fiscal year . \" The government 's fiscal year runs from October 1 - September 30 . Every year before the fiscal year ends , Congress must pass appropriations bills funding all the agencies of the federal government in order to authorize them to spend money . If agencies do n't have authorization to spend money , it is illegal for them to carry out any non - essential activities that require spending money , which is pretty much everything . ( An aside : you can see all the different appropriations bills and their progress here . URL_1 ) On the one hand , this is a good process in theory . Every year Congress has to look at the programs in place and decide whether they 're still worth funding at the old levels or whether something has changed and they should adjust funding levels . On the other hand , it runs into practical problems . The government has grown a lot since this process was put into place and there 's a lot more obstruction now than there was then , so most years this does n't actually happen on time . In order to deal with these delays , Congress tends to pass Continuing Resolutions ( CR ) to give itself some more time to work out the budgets of federal agencies it has not funded yet . A CR just says that whatever you had last year you get again this year , up to a certain date . So if last year your agency got $ 12 and this year we pass a 3 month CR , your agency will get $ 3 which it can spend over the next 3 months . So that sets up the debate right now , which is not actually over whether or not to fund the government . No appropriations bills have passed , and Republicans and Democrats broadly agree that we should continue to fund the government for a few months while they work out their differences on appropriations bills . The debate is about Obamacare . Republicans believe this is one of their last chances to repeal the law before it goes into effect . ( The other one is the debt ceiling , which you 've probably also heard about . They are related but distinct issues . ) As a result , some Republicans are refusing to vote to fund the government unless Obamacare is repealed / defunded . They believe that once the government is shut down , people will call on the Obama Administration to give in to Republican demands and start the government back up . Democrats and the Administration are unwilling to peel back their biggest achievement over the last five years to appease Republicans . I should note that I 'm on the Administration 's side on this one . I think I 've given a balanced view of what 's going on while keeping this on an ELI5 level . If anyone takes issue with the way I 've presented this , please say so and I 'll edit this post or respond to your criticism . * * Edit : TL;DR Government funding for many programs must be renewed annually by October 1 . Some Republicans insist on provisions that defund or undermine Obamacare in any funding bill . Democrats refuse to pass a bill with these provisions . * * * * Edit : FAQs :* * * How does this affect me right now ? * The best overview of government services that are going to get immediately suspended that I 've seen is from a post at [ Wonkblog ] ( URL_0 ) . Some Some key points : > Housing : The Department of Housing and Urban Development will not be able to provide local housing authorities with additional money for housing vouchers . The nation 's 3,300 public housing authorities will not receive payments , although most of these agencies , however , have funds to provide rental assistance through October . > > Regulatory agencies : The Environmental Protection Agency will close down almost entirely during a shutdown , save for operations around Superfund cites . The Commodity Futures Trading Commission will also shut down . A few financial regulators , however , like the Securities and Exchange Commission , will remain open . > > ( Small parts of ) Social Security : The Social Security Administration will keep on enough employees to make sure the checks keep going out . But the agency wo n't have enough staff to do things like help recipients replace their benefit cards or schedule new hearings for disability cases . > > Veterans : Some key benefits will continue and the VA hospitals will remained open . But many services will be disrupted . The Veterans Benefits Administration will be unable to process education and rehabilitation benefits . The Board of Veterans ' Appeals will be unable to hold hearings . * Does Congress keep getting paid ? * Members of Congress do continue to get paid because it 's unconstitutional to change their pay in the middle of a Congressional session . This is so they ca n't raise their own pay without giving the American people a chance to punish them for doing so . The way it 's written , though , it covers decreases in wages as well so that 's the way it is . Staff are treated like all other federal government employees - they are not paid until the government is funded again . In the past , when the government was funded again , federal employees have been given back pay retroactively . * Are state / local government services effected ? * This is a mixed bag . Anything funded purely through state and local funds should be unaffected unless money needs to be moved around to make up for a shortfall elsewhere . However , many state and local services are funded in part by the federal government , so you could see disruptions to a lot of services . Edit : I 've been gilded !

I suffered from very serious basal migraines for a while that have ( luckily ) gone away . There are currently two competing theories as to what causes migraines and causes the resulting pain . Some people claim they are vascular ( caused by a change in blood vessels ) while some say they are related to the nervous system . The vascular claim is , the blood vessels are contracting as a result of a stressor or trigger . A stimulus affects an area of the body consistently causing the blood vessels to constrict . This can cause a loss of oxygen to the area . In my case , parts of the brain were not getting blood and cells were essentially \" drowning \" from a lack of oxygen . Very similar to a stroke . The nervous system based claim I believe says that the nerves themselves are being overstimulated and producing pain signals . I believe this is more likely to be a reason in certain types of migraines ( I wan tot say that abdominal migraines were a type that was based on neurological influence ) . Needless to say , it could very well be a combination of the two and the cause will vary on the type of migraine one experiences .

There is a real impact on the markets - in the case of something like 9/11 due to closed airport, higher security costs, closer inspections on trade goods, tighter restrictions on visas, real payments for the rebuilding of destroyed buildings and insurance payouts for killed people, and eventually the cost of a war. But almost as important is the uncertainty and risk. Nobody knew what was going to happen in the days and weeks after an attack like that. Is there going to be another one a week later, or every week for the next year? Will air travel become essentially impractical? Will international trade be severely restricted? All those would have a huge, massive effect on the economy. You may argue that those things are very unlikely, even after something like 9/11. But even a small increase in the likelihood of a catastrophic economic crash is enough to start people selling. There is another thing that drives the market down. Even if most people are sure that there won't be a catastrophic economic crash, they know that other people think there might be and so will sell. That will drive the market down. If they know the market is going down, then sensible traders will start to sell, even if they think there is zero risk of a crash. This makes the effect worse. Eventually prices will drop so far that the people who don't think there is a crash will start to buy, so they can make a profit on the recovery.

This is not to say that interest rates cannot go up in Canada since the world is currently undergoing a resource bust, and the United States has begun exporting more oil, even trying to recently open the market to Europe, both of which Canada is relatively dependent upon. Also, to say that Canada currently has the most overpriced real estate is an oversight to say the least considering China currently has entire cities that are empty because prices are too high. A ten to twenty percent drop in real estate prices would probably be a full blown financial crisis, and since mortgage rates are currently around 2.5%, a one to two hundred basis point rise could mean a nearly 50% decrease in real estate prices if interest payments are held constant.  Canada would either have to start growing its economy at a much higher rate to encourage the central bank to raise rates to such a height, or oil would have to completely collapse suddenly to cause a speculatively possible collapse of CAD to encourage the same. The easiest relationship to manipulate between prices and rates is the perpetuity: where p is the price, i is the interest payment, and r is the interest rate.  In this case, an increase of r from 2.5% to 4.5% would cause a 44.5% decrease in p if i is held constant.  However, typical Canadian mortgages seem to mature in ten years at a fixed rate, so i cannot be held constant, and the relationship between r and p is less strong at earlier maturities, thus the most likely way for prices to collapse is for a financial collapse as described above.", "104": "Sex is what you have between your legs .

Wherever you go around the globe , similar latitudes will have similar day length and reasonably comparable temperatures .

Oats , Wheat , barley , and rye originated in different areas , but because they were all native to relatively similar latitudes they had a large variety of places they could be cultivated . 2 . A greater number of domesticable work / food animals : Cows , horses , sheep , goats , swine , chickens are all native to the Eurasian continent and were able to be densely cultivated across a large number of cultures . Not only was this of obvious utilitarian importance , it also inoculated these denser agricultural populations with zoonotic diseases which would prove crucial in conquest of the Americas .

You own a (very small) slice of Apple. As a stockholder, you have a vote on important decisions that the company makes.  Each year Apple has a stockholder meeting in Cupertino that you are invited to.  If you are unable to attend and vote, you can vote by proxy, which simply means that you register your vote before the meeting.  You just missed this year's meeting, which was held on February 26, 2016.  They elected people to the board of directors, chose an accounting firm, and voted on some other proposals.  Votes are based on the number of shares you own; since you only own one share, your vote is very small compared to some of the other stockholders. Besides voting, you are entitled to receive profit from the company, if the company chooses to pay this out in the form of dividends.  Apple's dividend for the last several quarters has been $0.52 per share, which means that you will likely receive 4 small checks from Apple each year. The value of the share of stock that you have changes daily.  Today, it is worth about $100.  You can sell this stock whenever you like; however, since you have a paper certificate, in order to sell this stock on the stock market, you would need to give your certificate to a stock broker before they can sell it for you. The broker will charge a fee to sell it for you.  Apple has a website for stockholders at investor.apple.com with some more information about owning Apple stock.

This means that an equity in one's account that is settled can be sold and can be purchased only with settled funds.

Margin A closed position is not considered a \"long\" or \"short\" since it is an account with one loan of security and one asset of security and one cash loan and one cash liability with the excess or deficit equity equal to any profit or loss, respectively, thus unexposed to the market, only to the creditworthiness of the clearing & settling chain. Only open positions are considered \"longs\" or \"shorts\", a \"long\" being a possession of a security, and a \"short\" being a liability, because they are exposed to the market. Since unsettled funds are not considered \"longs\" or \"shorts\", they are not encumbered by previous trades, thus only the Reg T rules apply to new and current positions. Cash vs Margin A cash account cannot purchase with unsettled funds.  A margin account can.  This means that a margin account could theoretically do an infinite amount of trades using unsettled funds.  A cash account's daily purchases are restricted to the amount of settled funds, so once those are exhausted, no more purchases can be made. The opposite is true for cash accounts as well.

The force of gravity is directly proportional to the mass of an object , and inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the center . We can divide out the volume of the sphere to get a percentage of the mass at a certain distance compared to the full mass , with the distance factor thrown in : ( r_current^3 ) /(r_current^2 r_total^3 ) . This means that we will get a function that falls off from the maximum gravitational pull at the surface to zero , with a cubic curve .

There's little you can do about closing costs. Some closing costs are government fees. There's nothing you can do about this. Sad and unfair as it is, taxes are not optional and not generally negotiable. Title insurance and fire insurance are required by the lender. Even if you're paying cash, you don't really want to skip on these. If your house burns down and you have no insurance ... well, if you're worried about saving a few hundred on your closing costs, I assume that losing $200,000 because your house burned down and you have no insurance would be a pretty bad thing. Title insurance protects you against the possibility that the seller doesn't really legally own the property, maybe a scam, more likely a mistake or a technicality. You can, and certainly should, shop around for a better deal on insurance. Last couple of housing transactions I made, title insurance was a one-time fee of around $200. (I'm sure this depends on the cost of the house, where you live, maybe other factors.) Maybe by shopping around I could have saved $10 or $20, but I doubt there's someone out there charging $50 when everyone else is charging $200. Fire insurance you're probably paying a couple of thousand a year, more opportunity for savings. Typically the buyer and the seller each have a realtor and they split the fee. If you go without a realtor but the seller hires one, she'll keep the entire fee. So the only way to avoid this expense is if neither of you has a realtor. I've never done that. Realtors cost a ton of money but they provide a useful service: not only helping you find a house but also knowing how to deal with all the paperwork. Plenty of people do it, though. I presume they get the title agency or the bank or somebody to help with the paperwork. There are also discount realtors out there who don't show your home, do little or nothing to market it, basically just help you with the paperwork, and then charge a very low fee. Timing closing for a certain day of the month can reduce what you owe at closing time -- by reducing the amount of interest you pay on the first month's loan payment -- but it doesn't save you any money. You'll make it up over the course of the loan. You might possibly save some money by timing closing around when property taxes are due. Theoretically this shouldn't matter: the theory is that they pro-rate property taxes between buyer and seller so each pays the taxes for the time when they own the house. So again, you might need less cash at closing but you'll make it up the next time property taxes are due. But the formulas the banks use on this are often goofy. Maybe if you live some place with high property taxes this is worth investigating. You could skip the inspection. But inspections I've had done generally cost about $500. If they found something that was a major issue, they might save you from buying a house that would cost tens of thousands in repairs. Or less dramatically, you can use the inspection report for leverage with the seller to get repairs done at the seller's expense. I once had an inspector report problems with the roof and so I negotiated with the seller that they would pay for a percentage of roof repair. I suppose if you're buying a house that you know is run down and will require major work, an inspection might be superfluous. Or if you know enough about construction that you can do an inspection yourself. Otherwise, it's like not buying insurance: sure, you save a little up front, but you're taking a huge risk. So what can you control? (a) Shop around for fire insurance. Maybe save hundreds of dollars. (b) Find a seller who's not using a realtor and then you don't use a realtor either. Save big bucks, 6 to 7% in my area, but you then have to figure out how to do all the paperwork yourself and you severely limit your buying options as most sellers DO use a realtor.

Nondividend distributions are nontaxable, so they do not represent income from capital gains, but do effect your cost basis when determining the capital gain/loss once that capital gain/loss is realized. As an example, publicly-traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) generally distribute a return of capital back to shareholders throughout the year as a nondividend distribution. This is a return of a portion of the shareholder's original capital investment, not a share of the REITs profits, so it is simply getting a portion of your original investment back, and thus, is not income being received (I like to refer to it as \"new income\" to differentiate). However, the return of capital does change the cost basis of the original investment, so if one were to then sell the shares of the REIT (in this example), the basis of the original investment has to be adjusted by the nondividend distributions received over the course of ownership (in other words, the cost basis will be reduced when the shares are sold).

Still, there are a variety of other reasons why such a stock might have gone up, or down, and no one [here] can say for sure.

Over the very long term, real house prices has stayed approximately constant. A house that is 10 years old today is 11 years old a year after, so this phenomenon of real house prices staying constant applies only to the market as a whole and not to an individual house, unless the individual house is maintained well. One house is an extremely poorly diversified investment. What if the house you buy turns out to have a mold problem? You can lose your investment almost overnight. In contrast to this, it is extremely unlikely that the same could happen on a well-diversified stock portfolio (although it can happen on an individual stock). Thus, if non-leveraged stock portfolio has a nominal return of 8% over the long term, I would demand higher return, say 10%, from a non-leveraged investment to an individual house because of the greater risks. If you have the ability to diversify your real estate investments, a portfolio of diversified real estate investments is safer than a diversified stock portfolio, so I would demand a nominal return of 6% over the long term from such a diversified portfolio. To decide if it's better to buy a house or to live in rental property, you need to gather all of the costs of both options (including the opportunity cost of the capital which you could otherwise invest elsewhere). The real return of buying a house instead of renting it comes from the fact that you do not need to pay rent, not from the fact that house prices tend to appreciate (which they won't do more than inflation over a very long term). For my case, I live in Finland in a special case of near-rental property where you pay 15% of the building cost when moving in (and get the 15% payment back when moving out) and then pay a monthly rent that is lower than the market rent. The property is subsidized by government-provided loans. I have calculated that for my case, living in this property makes more sense than purchasing a market-priced house, but your situation may be different.", "189": "First , look at the purposes of camouflage on aircraft . In past and present years they had three different goals -- disguise the aircraft on the ground , Disguise the aircraft in the air , or a scheme to make it difficult to judge an aircraft 's distance away , speed , altitude , etc . Green camo falls into the first category . Green camo was common decades ago ( WWII for example ) , In those eras most reconnaissance was still completed by aircraft and bombings were done based on visual recognition -- green camo made it difficult to see aircraft on the ground . Keep in mind that many of the airstrips of the time were simple and there were n't many hangers . Modern grey camo is the best choice for aircraft today . We do n't see blue sky everyday and grey has been found to be the best choice for all weather conditions .

Since this is unrelated to your studies, this income will not be covered by the tax treaties for most countries, and you'll pay full taxes on it. Keep in mind that the IRS may decide that you're actually having a business, in which case you'll be required to attach Schedule C to your tax return and maybe pay additional taxes (mainly self-employment).

A security is , in the most generic sense , a thing which you buy today for some price $ X , and which you sell in the future for some price $ Y , with the goal being that Y should be greater than X. It 's a simple idea : You buy low , and then you sell high , and you end up making money on the deal . One type of security is a * share in a mutual fund . * You know how you can buy shares of stock which give you an ownership stake in a company ? Like imagine you own a company that makes widgets . You can divide the ownership of that company up into pieces , called shares , and then give some to yourself and sell the rest . These shares are securities , in the sense that we defined above : They can be bought , held on to for a time , then sold at a different , and ideally higher , price than what was originally paid for them , because in the time between buying and selling the shares became more valuable . A mutual fund works * kind of * like that . It 's basically a pool of money which is used to buy securities , but rather than each member of the pool directly owning some of the securities , the securities are owned by the * fund itself * , and the members of the pool own * shares in the fund . * You might buy a share of a mutual fund which owns shares in the widget company we described above , but then sells those shares and uses the money to buy shares in a different company , one that makes gadgets . When those shares in the gadget company have gained in value a bit , those shares are sold and the money 's used to buy shares in yet another company , this one making thingamagigs . And so on , and so on … but you , as a shareholder in the fund , do n't need to worry about any of that . All you need to know is that the shares you own in the fund as a whole are accruing value over time through the wise buying and selling of securities on the part of the fund manager , the person responsible for managing the fund 's portfolio and increasing its value over time . Of course , the basic rule of buying and selling assets applies to mutual funds as well : You are not guaranteed to make money . In fact , you are n't even guaranteed to * keep * the money you start out with . It 's possible for mutual funds to lose value over time , meaning if you put $ 10,000 into one right now , a year from now your share of the fund might only be worth $ 9,000 . So why would you put money into a mutual fund rather than just putting it into an interest - bearing deposit account , or buying bonds with it ? Because an interest - bearing deposit account or bond investment might , over a year , turn your $ 10,000 into $ 10,300 if you get a good rate … while a mutual fund * has a chance * of turning your $ 10,000 into $ 12,000 in the same time . There 's a chance for bigger returns , balanced by a chance that you might lose value over time . ( This is pretty rare , though . Most mutual funds are well - managed , and give you returns that are * at least * somewhat better than what you could get from risk - free investing over the same period of time . ) Now the question becomes , how do you go about buying shares in a mutual fund ? Well , the most obvious way is just to walk into the office of some mutual fund someplace and write them a check . But when you do this , you need to know two things . First , the money you use to buy the shares of that fund has * already been taxed . * If you earned $ 30,000 last year and paid $ 10,000 of it in taxes , the $ 20,000 you have left is all you have to buy shares of the fund with . The other thing to know is that in the future , when you cash out of the mutual fund , * you 're going to be taxed again * on the * profits * you made from your investment . The rate at which those profits are taxed depends on how long you stayed in the fund and how much you made when you got out , but the point is the government is going to take a cut . The way around this is to structure your investment as a Roth IRA . IRA stands for \" individual retirement account \" , and a Roth IRA is a type of IRA ( named for the guy in the Senate who sponsored the law that created it ) . The virtue of structuring your investment as a Roth IRA is that if you follow certain rules , you can get * out * of having to pay taxes on the profit the investment pays you . These rules are pretty complicated , and involve contribution limits — a limit to how much you can put into your investment every year — and seasoning times — how long you have to leave the money in the investment before you can take it out . But as long as you work within those rules , a Roth IRA backed by a well - managed mutual fund can be a really good way to store your money , protect its value against inflation ( by getting a return on your investment that 's equal to the rate of inflation ) , and make a decent profit for your trouble ."}
